 # Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Destiny

I'm a passionate **full-stack software engineer** who thrives on solving puzzles, whether itâ€™s debugging tricky code or building user-friendly applications that make a real impact. My journey into tech began with customizing MySpace profiles in high school, and itâ€™s been a love affair with code ever since.

I completed a rigorous **full-stack web development bootcamp** through Pursuit and have experience with technologies like **React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL**. Iâ€™m always learning something newâ€”currently diving into **Android and React-Native development** to expand my expertise.

### A Little More About Me:
- ðŸ’¡ I love building intuitive solutions that streamline workflows and enhance user experiences.
- ðŸŽ¬ When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably re-watching *Frasier* for the "50-leventh" time (let's talk about your favorite episode!).
- ðŸŒ± Cooking is my therapy, especially creating fresh vegan meals that fuel both body and mind.
- ðŸŽ® Balancing my love for tech with my video game addictionâ€”thereâ€™s always one more mission, right?
- ðŸ“š Lifelong learner: Currently diving into **Generative AI** and staying curious about the latest tech trends.

Iâ€™m also the creator of **inIT**, a job search app designed for entry-level developers, helping recruiters find talent without the job market noise. 

If you're into coding, good conversation, or *Frasier*, letâ€™s connect and create something amazing! ðŸ’»âœ¨
